I want one place to keep track of ideas for microproducts (mostly). I have them strewn around in all kinds of places from Evernote to Google Keep to Google docs. 

You are free to take any of these ideas (if they make sense) and use them. If you are a student and want to work on one of them, please ping me and I can write up a more detailed document about the idea. 

Right now, I plan to use a simple template - What, Why and Who. 

What - Describes the idea briefly
Why - Describes (my) motivation behind the idea
Who - Talks about potential users and what they can use the idea for
